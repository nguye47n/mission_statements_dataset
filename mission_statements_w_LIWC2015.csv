AMERICAN UNIVERSITY,"The place of American University among major universities with first-rate faculties and academic programs grounded in the arts and sciences is secured by its enduring commitment to uncompromising quality in the education of its students. But its distinctive feature, unique in higher education, is its capacity as a national and international university to turn ideas into action and action into service by emphasizing the arts and sciences, then connecting them to the issues of contemporary public affairs writ large, notably in the areas of government, communication, business, law, and international service.
Recognized for its emphasis on personalized teaching and experiential education, the university provides for the direct involvement of faculty and students in the institutions and culture of the most important capital city in the world. Since its founding by an Act of Congress in 1893 as a private, independent, coeducational institution, under the auspices of The United Methodist Church, American University has been a national and international university. This is reflected in the scope of its teaching and research programs and the diversity of its faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and student body, today representing over 135 countries.
The university actively encourages a commitment to public service, inclusive participation in university governance, equity and equal access, and an appreciation of diverse cultures and viewpoints. Its commitment to social justice, its ability to respond to the needs of a changing world while retaining its core values, and its capacity to turn to educational advantage the resources of the nation's capital are hallmarks of the institution.
The university distinguishes itself through a broad array of undergraduate and graduate programs that stem from these primary commitments:
interdisciplinary inquiry transcending traditional boundaries among academic disciplines and between administrative units
international understanding reflected in curriculum offerings, faculty research, study abroad and internship programs, student and faculty representation, and the regular presence of world leaders on campus
interactive teaching providing personalized educational experiences for students, in and out of the classroom
research and creative endeavors consistent with its distinctive mission, generating new knowledge beneficial to society
practical application of knowledge through experiential learning, taking full advantage of the resources of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area
The central commitment of American University is to the development of thoughtful, responsible human beings in the context of a challenging yet supportive academic community.",2722,384,46,1,359,157,7.088541666666667,386,99.00,67.94,30.12,84.95,48.25,44.30,84.46,41.45,4.66,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,4.40,9.59,18.13,1.81,0.26,7.51,0.00,3.11,5.44,1.55,0.00,0.78,0.52,3.37,3.37,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.70,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.74,2.59,1.30,0.26,0.26,1.81,1.04,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.88,1.81,2.33,6.22,1.04,0.26,0.26,2.85,0.26,14.51,1.30,11.40,1.81,17.36,0.52,0.00,0.52,0.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.92,2.59,8.55,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00

Bluxome Street Winery,"It‚Äôs a little known fact that California winemaking started not in Napa or Sonoma, but right here in San Francisco‚ÄîSOMA, to be exact. At the time, SOMA was called South of the Slot (the slot being the cable car line that ran down Market Street) and it was both a dashing and dastardly place to behold. Home to heroes and scoundrels, artists and working men, familiar to the likes of Isadora Duncan and Jack London, SOMA was the stuff of legend‚Äînot to mention the birthplace of great wine. In fact, dozens of wineries and commercial cellars called SOMA home. Sadly, the 1906 earthquake ended many of the dreams in this neck of the woods, and whatever spark remained alive was quickly snuffed by the 18th Amendment. Until now, that is. Welcome to Bluxome Street Winery.
 
 We love wine. A very particular kind of wine‚Äîone that speaks to its roots while lending itself smashingly to food‚Äîfruit bombs be damned. To create it, we source high-quality fruit from low-yield vineyards in cool Sonoma regions, farmed by like-minded individuals who value meticulous farming and long walks amongst their vines. We let Mother Nature do a lion‚Äôs share of our winemaking, so the character of the fruit remains intact in the glass.",1227,208,29,4,169,86,5.899038461538462,215,94.46,75.74,21.56,77.19,19.55,18.60,73.95,43.26,8.37,2.33,0.00,1.86,0.00,0.00,0.47,6.05,8.37,14.42,4.65,1.86,6.05,0.47,10.23,2.79,0.47,0.93,0.93,0.93,5.58,4.19,1.40,0.00,0.47,0.93,7.44,0.47,0.00,0.47,0.47,5.12,0.47,1.40,0.00,0.93,1.40,1.40,1.86,0.00,0.47,0.47,4.19,0.47,0.47,0.00,2.79,7.44,3.72,0.93,1.86,0.47,0.47,4.65,4.19,0.00,14.42,1.86,9.30,3.72,1.40,2.33,0.93,0.93,0.00,0.47,0.93,0.47,0.00,0.47,0.00,0.00,13.49,5.12,6.05,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.40,0.00,0.00,0.93,0.00

BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,"Brandeis University is a community of scholars and students united by their commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and its transmission from generation to generation. As a research university, Brandeis is dedicated to the advancement of the humanities, arts and social, natural and physical sciences. As a liberal arts college, Brandeis affirms the importance of a broad and critical education in enriching the lives of students and preparing them for full participation in a changing society, capable of promoting their own welfare, yet remaining deeply concerned about the welfare of others.

In a world of challenging social and technological transformations, Brandeis remains a center of open inquiry and teaching, cherishing its independence from any doctrine or government. It strives to reflect the heterogeneity of the United States and of the world community whose ideas and concerns it shares. In the belief that the most important learning derives from the personal encounter and joint work of teacher and students, Brandeis encourages undergraduates and postgraduates to participate with distinguished faculty in research, scholarship and artistic activities.

Brandeis was founded in 1948 as a nonsectarian university under the sponsorship of the American Jewish community to embody its highest ethical and cultural values and to express its gratitude to the United States through the traditional Jewish commitment to education. By being a nonsectarian university that welcomes students, teachers and staff of every nationality, religion and orientation, Brandeis renews the American heritage of cultural diversity, equal access to opportunity and freedom of expression.

The university that carries the name of the justice who stood for the rights of individuals must be distinguished by academic excellence, by truth pursued wherever it may lead and by awareness of the power and responsibilities that come with knowledge.",1937,289,24,0,265,129,6.70242214532872,289,98.77,76.63,7.73,92.30,32.11,40.48,85.12,45.67,5.88,1.04,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.04,4.84,10.73,18.34,2.42,1.04,9.00,0.00,4.50,4.84,2.08,1.04,0.35,1.73,5.54,4.50,0.35,0.00,0.35,0.00,8.65,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.30,2.77,1.38,0.35,1.38,1.73,1.38,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.38,0.00,0.69,0.00,0.69,12.46,3.11,3.46,5.88,1.38,0.00,1.04,3.11,0.69,8.65,1.73,5.88,1.04,11.76,1.38,0.00,0.35,1.38,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.30,3.11,5.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00

EBERHARD KARLS UNIVERSITÄT TÜBINGEN,"Core Values
The University of Tübingen is committed to the highest standards of research and teaching across a broad spectrum of subjects.
The University encourages interdisciplinary and international cooperation and upholds academic freedom in research and teaching, while acknowledging that the search for knowledge must be ethical.
The University regards variety as essential to academic excellence and therefore supports equality between its members.
It also provides further training in a variety of fields to equip its members with necessary non-academic skills.
 
1. Research and Teaching
The University reinforces its basic research with outstanding performance in core areas. Its policy of targeted funding takes in collaborative research centers, research groups, research training groups and outstanding individual research, as well as partnerships with business and industry. The University also collaborates with other universities in the region and with government-funded research institutions.

PhD networks help to integrate young researchers into structured doctoral studies while promoting interdisciplinary research projects. The University also provides help for young researchers whose work has potentially commercial applications.

Tübingen offers international degree courses and the chance to integrate periods of study abroad into its own courses, strengthening the University's international teaching and research profile and making it attractive to foreign students.
   
2. Ethics and Academic Freedom
The University provides its scientists and academics with a research-friendly environment and the freedom necessary for creativity. Students are confronted with burning issues in research at an early stage, and are encouraged to take an active role in research projects. The International Center for Ethics in the Sciences and Humanities explores ethical problems arising from research.
 
3. Equality
The University values diversity and promotes equal opportunities among its members regardless of gender, social and religious background, disability and sexual orientation. It therefore also creates family-friendly conditions for students, employees, academics and scientists.
  
4. Further Training
The University has implemented quality controls to monitor and continually improve its performance in research, teaching and study, services and administration.

The University of Tübingen provides further education as a part of its members’ process of lifelong learning in a world of rapid technological and social change. This includes training for lecturers in improved teaching methods as well as courses in business skills and languages in the Studium Professionale. The University also assists graduate entrepreneurs with research and development contracts and patent licensing and provides concrete support for startups. The Studium Generale program of extracurricular lectures provides a forum for University researchers to share their work and present it to a public audience.",3015,415,41,0,357,151,7.265060240963855,419,96.14,76.30,4.39,93.28,17.46,47.97,84.73,38.42,4.30,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.24,4.06,7.16,15.27,1.67,2.39,10.26,0.00,3.10,7.64,3.58,0.24,0.95,1.91,5.73,4.77,0.48,0.00,0.24,0.00,7.40,0.24,0.72,0.00,0.00,5.49,0.95,1.67,1.19,0.48,1.19,0.24,0.72,0.48,0.00,0.24,0.48,0.00,0.24,0.24,0.00,12.89,4.77,2.86,5.01,1.19,0.24,0.24,5.01,0.24,10.74,0.72,7.88,2.15,22.43,0.24,0.24,0.95,0.24,0.00,0.48,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.48,0.00,10.02,5.73,2.86,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.95,0.00,0.48,0.00,0.00

Good Karma Bikes,"Good Karma Bikes is a non-profit social enterprise consisting of a full second hand bike shop and service center. All of our bikes are donated to Good Karma Bikes and refurbished in our work shop by volunteers.
 
 But Good Karma Bikes is not about the bikes, it about utilizing the revenue generated by our bike shop and services to pay for our social programs; working with former foster and disadvantaged youth, as well as providing safe, reliable bicycle transportation, and repair services for homeless and low income working people.
 
 In fact, for every bike we sell we currently give away 1.4 bikes or services.
 
 Our primary program, and the one we are proudest of, is with a select group of former foster and disadvantaged youth providing work readiness and college entrance via a two-year Life, Work and College program that gives them a solid foundation for moving forward. 
 
 In the first 6 months we work with them to establish good housing, medical coverage and start to put a college transcript in place while they earn a stipend from Good Karma Bikes for working in our repair shop and retail area learning Life, Business and communications lessons and skills. During this time, we start the college application program and we help all of them get into college and support them during their college education with customized workshops that continue to provide the life lessons they need to succeed in college and life.

INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY MADRAS (IITM),"The Goals and Objectives were derived from the Sarkar Committee Report and embodied in the IIT Act. In addition to the Sarkar Committee report, the IIT act and the Statutes of the IITs indicate the lines along which IITs should develop. According to these documents IITs are expected

to be higher technical institutions and research in some branches of Engineering on the lines of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - better known as MIT;
to provide for instruction and research in some branches of Engineering and Technology, Science and Arts for the advancement of learning and dissemination of knowledge in specific branches.
 

The two broad objectives which emerge from the above line of development are

the advancement of knowledge through education and research, in both Pure and Applied Science, in engineering, Social science and Humanities;
service to the community and nation (which are referred to as Extension activity) through the use if their resources both intellectual and material, particularly through Continuing Education for professionals working in Industry.
 

The Science Policy Resolution (SPR) of the Government of India (1958) is a basic document of relevance to the IITs. The SPR resolves

to foster, promote and sustain scientific research in all aspects - pure, applied and educational;
to ensure adequate supply of research scientists of higher quality;
to recognize the work of research scientists as an important component of the strength of the nation;
to encourage programmes for the training of scientific and technical personnel to fulfill the country's needs in science and education, agriculture and industry, and defense;
to encourage dissemination and discovery of knowledge in an atmosphere of scientific freedom.
 

IITs also constitute a major source for research scientists of high caliber; they also are expected to serve the people of India and provide the country with benefits of application of their discovery and knowledge and as such are entitled to academic freedom and research support as implied in the SPR.

Much in the some manner as IITs are part of the successful implementation of the SPR, they now have a greater responsibility for fulfilling the relevant goals of the Technology Policy Statement as well. As Institutes of Technology, their charter, is to resonate the expectations spelt out in the Technology Policy Statement.

The Technology Policy Statement (1983) affirms interalia, that

technology must relate to our people's aspirations and to our local needs;
technology covers both manufacturing and servicing sectors.
 

The Statement affirms that the base for this consists of trained manpower, which IITs are charged to develop. It envisages special attention to the promotion of newly emerging and frontier areas and encouraging research in these areas.

IITs have a specific role to implement these avowed objectives of the Technology Policy Statement within their general charter of education, research and extension.

Such goals require that IITs must

excel in all aspects of academic activity and produce a high quality science based engineering students;
survive on specialization, work increasingly in front-line areas that transcend disciplines;
have a perception and a value system appropriate to the pursuit of high science and high engineering science to meet the critically evaluated needs of the society in terms if products and processes using indigenous resources in close collaboration wit manufacturing service sectors;
programme into their activities the emerging technological needs with a futuristic outlook;
accept extension and public services as a third dimension to their role in addition to education and research;
attain a stature that enables them to provide leadership with credibility. They should be the ""think tanks"" for higher education and research;
aim at preparing more of ""creative engineers"", ""innovative thinkers"" and ""engineer entrepreneurs"";
develop a special nexus with rural development mainly by way of involvement in technology based solutions for problems in rural areas;
maintain and foster interactive linkages with leading technological institutions and centers of research in India and abroad.
Education
The purpose of educational programmes in the IITs should be

to develop in each student mastery of fundamentals, versatility of mind, motivation for learning, intellectual discipline and self-reliance which provide the best foundation for continuing professional achievement;
to provide a liberal; as well as a professional education so that each student acquires a respect for moral values, a sense of their duties as a citizen, a feeling for taste and style, and a better human understanding. All these are required for leadership;
to send forth men and women of the highest professional competence with a breath of learning and a character to deal constructively with issues, and problems anticipated in the next decade relevant to the programmes of development of our country.
Research and scholarship
IITs must seek through their research activities to create an atmosphere of intellectual excitement, a climate of inquiry and innovation in which a student develops a consuming interest for understanding issues of his own volition.

Extension
As Indian Institutes of Technology, they must recognize their inherent obligation to serve students and alumni, the profession of engineering, the world of scholarship the nation and the society at large . IITs should seek to serve the community directly through the use of their facilities, wherever there is a need, to which they can respond easily . These objectives are derived from the original goals and not construed de-novo.

The Report of the Committee on Post Graduation Engineering Education lays stress on the thrust areas such as Fibre Optics, Micro-electronics, Materials Science, Reliability Engineering, Robotics, Ocean Engineering, Computer Science etc. IITs have a significant role to build a superstructure in the form of Postgraduate Programmes in such thrust areas that go to influence the quality of Undergraduate Curriculum. In order to develop a curriculum they need to interact and develop linkages with their surroundings specially within the manufacture and service sectors.

During our discussions several questions arose while spelling out goals of IITs, such as

should not the IITs mainly concentrate on forging links with organized industrial sector for import and diversification of its technology;
should IITs commit their resources for developing appropriate rural technology for mass impact;
should not the Institutes strive for an optimal blend of a limited number of objectives in order that they do not spread their resources thinly.
 

We are clear in our minds that the Technology Policy Statement and the Science Policy Resolution demand a conscious integrated approach covering technology assessment, technology acquisition, absorption, utilization and diffusion. This responsibility cannot be solely placed on the IITs. But IITs cannot escape participation in one or more aspects of Technology development along with others . Technology policy studies may be initiated in or more IITs to enable them to to have a proper appraisal of modern technologies, and arrive at an assessment of their relevance to the needs of our society. Such studies will help orient research and curriculum to produce engineers alive to the needs of the nation . IITs would no longer be accused of training to the needs of the developed.

Specific Goals
Within the overall goals outlined some specific goals should be spelled out. It is that the IITs must continue to engage in manpower development but their students must be different and special. An IIT student must be an agent of change of Technology practice in the country, and initiate a new working culture in our industry, with a view to increase productivity and bring to industry the capacity to innovate. Some IIT graduates should, therefore, become entrepreneurs themselves for starting new science based, technology oriented industries. They are thus to be so trained by the IITs as to build into their value system, a sense of responsibility to their country and a desire to serve for the society. Their perception should preclude Hi-Tech. as an important tool to solve ground level problems.

IITs must continue to interact more closely with other technology institutions and be the leading centers of Technical Teacher training. Faculty in the IITs should become visible agents of change, as natural partners for upgrading standards of Technical Education, research in general, and specifically development of newer programmes in the technical institutions in the region where they are located.

Some of the IITs,who have locational advantages, can involve themselves in the tasks related to the development of R&D in the industry by means of supplying competent technical manpower and by offering laboratory solutions to the problems faced by the industry. Their method of instruction should be innovative and qualitatively different. For instance, Micro-electronics may be taught in other colleges as an educational programme, but IITs who have research excellence in their proximity, on the other hand, would bring in a practical bias and illustrate a number of case studies relevant to their curricula. Their functions of teaching, research and extension would be perceived as an integrated block and not as separate identities. Without such an integration, a teacher cannot develop the personality of the taught in a wholesome fashion, relating what is taught to actual experience.The teacher's activity in extension activity will improve the quality of his research, in turn improving his teaching content.The students will then see him as the leader in research whose work is relevant.Some of the alumni settled abroad while responding to our questionnaire mentioned that a major cause of their migration abroad is the baseness of academic and research leaders in IITs.They find that the leaders mentioned in reputed forums are Professors working in institutions abroad, but not the Professors of the IITs. It is this excitement to be able to work as students of these international leaders soon after their graduation that lures them to migrate abroad referred to as ""brain-drain"". Only by attaining such status and international reputation that the faculty in the IIT can motivate most of these brilliant students to stay back and work with them.

As the information Age is ushering in, thanks to the technological advancements in the area of Microelectronics, Materials Engineering and Bio-technology etc.,the country will look towards IITs to be lead-agents for promoting training, research support and technology development in many such thrust areas. The goals of an IIT,therefore, must specifically include helping such changes happen in this country in a programmed manner and faster. It is for each IIT to decide on what priority areas they need to emphasize, from time to time to plan for them.

Extension activities will make their programmes realistic, their research work more relevant and they will acquire expertise enough to act as consultants to a consultant. Such orientation alone will enable IITs to become an important link between Technology and Development.

Academic
Strive to be relevant and excellent
Engage themselves in teaching, training, research, publication and extension work of relevance
Remain within optimum size in order to be effective
Concentrate in selected areas of technology which can help remove impediments facing the country's goal of self-reliance
Produce creative and innovative engineers
Become consultant to consultants
Engage in trans-disciplinary education and research
Make pioneering effort specially in frontier areas of technology
Inculcate the desired perception and value -system in their students both by personal example and by precept
Organizational
Functions in a decentralized way
Earn more and depend less on budgetary support from the State
Sharpen the cutting edge of the knowledge from time to time ;
 

and for which survive on specialization and intellectual elitism attempt to be cost-effective in all endeavors prepare for and assume a leadership role in Technical Teacher Training. These are indicated to illustrate a number of objectives that IITs can have,although, from time to time they will emphasize one or the other objective,relevant at the time.

Implementation
Our recommendations are all related to the achievement of these goals. we would like to emphasize at this stage,that all the effort that has gone into shaping these views supported by a number of people, within the IIT system, within the country as well as a number of experts and alumni abroad, will not bear fruit, unless these recommendations are examined,and decisions announced.Equally important is to act on such decisions quickly and effectively. During our visits to IITs,many have doubted whether there is an effective machinery available for implementing such decisions.We are very clear that the changes which we are suggesting are in tune within the policies and needs of our time and these can be implemented if there is clearly enunciated policy backed by the Government.it is also necessary to translate their backing by providing qualified and competent manpower for implementation.Wherever the Government is committed, implementation becomes easier.If recommendations are acted upon changes will be clear and visible in five years time.

We gather that currently the management of IIT desk in the ministry is clubbed with other duties,and there is hardly, any time to nurture and extend the support necessary from Government to these institutions e.g. in the council of IITs to deal with issues arising in parliament. It is essential that the Ministry of Human Resource Development should deal with IITs as the sole concern of a whole time officer without any other major load added to him.To be effective, he must be at a sufficiently at a senior level .He should be backed with qualified staff who could initiate in the next few years a mechanism for implementation. We would emphasize that this aspect be taken into account while examining your recommendations.

The second important aspect of for successful implementation of the suggestions made by us, is specific policy support of the Government of India, e.g.

association of IITs with policy planning agencies of the Government like Department of Electronics for import of electronic equipment, DGTD with regard to technology import and development etc.energy conservation, and other areas of S&T work.
encouraging industry by way of tax concessions for their contribution to establish meaningful linkages with the IITs
freeing them from bureaucratic interferences, ensuring autonomy and demanding accountability
encouraging measures necessary to create situations where IIT alumni remain engaged within the country in challenging tasks.
engaging IITs in selective thrust areas of development
considering them as focal points think tanks in in the matter of framing technical education policies at graduate levels and beyond
National pension scheme for faculty for easy mobility into industry and R&D organizations
support for entrepreneurship effort of faculty and for those successful in efforts for indigenous technology development
external support to the IIT management for enforcing higher standards of achievement and reward merit both in faculty and employees
supporting IITs to establish and enforce separation policy for faculty, based on objective assessment and giving policy backing as necessary in this regard
helping IITs to remain high in their standards even if it means modifying some government policies in the sphere of reservations or industrial relations
central plan provisions for removal of obsolescence
faculty housing and provision of modern computers for the IITs",15990,2448,234,19,2185,1084,6.5318627450980395,2476,97.63,70.73,12.77,81.18,39.30,34.29,80.05,46.04,6.18,3.19,0.00,0.73,0.04,0.28,2.14,2.99,8.28,19.10,5.33,1.78,6.66,0.53,7.92,4.85,2.30,0.85,0.32,1.66,3.76,3.39,0.32,0.08,0.00,0.04,6.83,0.00,0.04,0.04,0.32,10.54,3.31,2.10,2.22,1.21,1.58,1.62,0.93,0.36,0.04,0.12,0.24,0.12,0.04,0.00,0.08,10.06,1.53,4.04,4.52,1.70,0.32,0.48,6.14,0.97,11.75,1.17,8.76,1.82,13.05,0.04,0.04,0.32,0.12,0.04,0.20,0.00,0.08,0.00,0.12,0.00,9.45,3.19,3.76,0.00,0.89,0.00,0.00,0.61,0.40,0.16,0.32,0.12

IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,"owa State's focus has always been its students. The university emphasizes learning by doing. ISU students take advantage of many opportunities to engage in real-world class experiences and cutting-edge research, to study in other countries, and to test their leadership skills in 800-plus campus organizations. They are tomorrow's leaders and problem solvers and they're ready to get started. In addition to educating students, Iowa State faculty and staff are conducting basic and applied research to improve lives and sustain the planet. They are boosting crop production, protecting natural resources, perfecting biobased fuels, refining wind turbines, designing human and animal vaccines, improving firefighting gear, fighting Parkinson's disease, fostering economic growth and development, strengthening forensic science techniques, assessing the effects of media violence, devising defenses against cyber attacks, enhancing the quality of life through the arts and humanities, and educating the leaders of tomorrow. As a member of the Association of American Universities, and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, Iowa State is dedicated to conducting research and scholarship with local, national, and international impact.

As the land-grant institution in the very first state to adopt the Morrill Act, Iowa State University wholeheartedly supports the mission of sharing knowledge beyond the campus borders. It's no surprise that Iowa State pioneered the first statewide Extension Service in 1906. The extension experiment – universities actively transferring their research and expertise to every corner of every state – was immensely successful across America and remains so today. More than a million Iowans annually benefit directly from ISU Extension and Outreach programs.

As the world has gotten smaller, the scope of Iowa State's mission has increased. ISU faculty, staff, and students are dedicated to improving lives around the nation and the world. The Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence is helping to improve forensic evidence to create a more objective criminal justice system. The Center for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods helps support a longstanding program to help Ugandans improve farming, launch home businesses, keep children in school, and build food security. Through these activities and many others, Iowa State presses forward, on a mission to help make the world safe and sustainable for generations to come.",2486,362,55,3,303,123,6.867403314917127,365,97.04,65.96,14.00,98.13,22.81,39.18,74.79,35.07,2.74,1.10,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.10,1.64,7.40,13.97,3.84,1.10,7.95,0.27,7.95,3.84,1.92,0.00,1.37,1.64,7.67,6.58,1.10,0.00,0.55,0.00,5.48,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.75,1.37,1.64,0.27,0.27,1.37,1.10,0.82,0.00,0.00,0.27,1.64,0.00,1.37,0.00,0.27,12.33,1.92,4.38,4.93,2.47,1.10,1.10,6.03,0.55,12.33,1.64,8.49,2.74,12.33,0.27,0.27,0.82,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.07,4.38,7.67,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.37,0.00,1.64,0.00,0.00

LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITÄT HANNOVER,"Teaching as a dialogue – the focus is on the student

We consider teaching to be a dynamic partnership between teacher and taught. Our broad range of subjects provides opportunities for students to gain tailor-made qualifications and opens up a wide variety of avenues for professional and personal development. We educate the experts of tomorrow by offering forward-looking courses with an interdisciplinary focus to interested and motivated students. Our teaching staff are committed to providing the best possible guidance and advice to our students. We constantly review and develop our courses, facilitate the transition from school to university and support life-long learning.

Research as a challenge – we aim for the top

We define core research areas so as to consolidate our strengths and achieve outstanding results in international competition. Our exemplary facilities and cooperation agreements with external institutions provide ideal conditions for research. Excellent education and the support of the next academic generation are among our most important tasks. Challenging and internationally competitive graduate schools contribute to this.

Lundberg Design,"We are located in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco, in a 1933 mattress factory building. It is a perfect building for the kind of firm we are ‚Äì raw concrete walls and exposed timber trusses, with high volumes and enough square footage to house our architectural practice, fabrication shop, and even a work-week apartment for Olle. The practice has always been very diverse ‚Äì we have designed homes, restaurants, wineries, corporate headquarters, distilleries, hotels, apartment buildings, bars, lobbies, and even San Francisco‚Äôs bus shelters. We describe our style as ‚Äúnature-inspired modernism,‚Äù and we strive for elegant, simple solutions in our work. We like materials with substance ‚Äì wood, stone, steel; materials with heft and texture ‚Äì really the opposite of veneer. For us the making of architecture is a collaborative act; between ourselves and especially with our clients ‚Äì while we aim for poetry we also pride ourselves on making buildings that work very, very well.
 
 The work is quite personal ‚Äì to our clients, to the site, and to us; and to that end we have always had a fabrication shop as part of our practice. It is a place to experiment with materials and details; it is a place to build things. The shop is a way to emphasize the notion of craft in our projects ‚Äì the unique piece handmade for just that moment. This enables us to at times act a little more like a sculptor, where the process of making begins to inform the end result, so that the pieces really do end up being one-of-a-kind. The act of making is different from just drawing an idea ‚Äì no matter the cost the mark of the hand makes the piece a kind of gift, unique and personal to that client. It is an inseparable part of our design practice.",1763,305,44,0,276,141,5.780327868852459,310,91.63,91.72,5.30,68.39,25.83,22.90,77.10,49.35,10.65,7.10,0.00,7.10,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.55,10.32,14.19,5.48,4.52,5.16,0.32,8.39,4.19,2.26,0.32,0.65,1.94,2.90,2.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.39,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,7.42,1.29,2.90,0.00,0.97,1.29,1.29,0.65,0.32,0.00,0.32,0.97,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.65,12.58,7.74,3.87,0.65,0.32,0.00,0.65,8.71,0.00,8.71,0.00,5.48,3.23,4.84,2.58,1.94,1.29,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,14.19,3.87,7.42,0.00,1.29,0.00,0.00,1.61,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00

RADBOUD UNIVERSITY NIJMEGEN,"Radboud University Nijmegen is
a student-oriented research university
where research and teaching are
closely intertwined and where
almost all academic disciplines are
represented. The Humanities,
Natural Sciences, Behavioural and
Social Sciences and Medical Sciences
all have their place at Radboud

the leading universities in Europe.
To that end, the university has
created an intellectual climate that
inspires and challenges staff and

for solutions to important research
questions and to the problems facing
society. These scholars operate in an
atmosphere of complete academic
freedom, with an eye to ethical
questions and the social implications
of their research. They conduct their
research in interdisciplinary groups
across the full range of academic
disciplines, thereby ensuring that
pure and applied research reinforce
one another.
Radboud University is a studentoriented
university. Its teaching is
based on the most recent scientific
insights and opinions. By adopting a
critical stance, students learn to
understand complex issues and to
make a commitment to invest
actively in their own development.
But education at Radboud University
is about more than knowledge. Each
individual student receives the
attention they need. Radboud
University aims to help its students
develop into conscientious graduates
who engage with society, and who
are prepared to take up positions of
responsibility and play a leading role.
Philosophical reflection on their own
field of study is a standard part of the
programme for every student.
Radboud University is a Catholic
university. The Christian tradition
from which it originated helps define
its research and teaching, and creates
a sense of unity among staff and
students.
Radboud University works together
with universities at home and
abroad. In addition, it is always
looking to enter into dialogue with
other national and international
organisations, thereby constantly
improving its academic research and
teaching, and preparing its students
for an international future.

RMIT UNIVERSITY,"RMIT exists to create transformative experiences for our students, getting them ready for life and work, and to help shape the world with research, innovation, teaching and engagement.

RMIT embraces the task of extending the benefits of a fast-innovating, high-skill knowledge economy to our whole community and our world. We are dedicated to helping shape a new urban and industrial renaissance in the global economy.

We are driven by impact and focused on the challenges and opportunities emerging around us.

As the world economy transforms, we have a responsibility to make the resulting changes work for the whole of society.

Our distinctive approach to connected education and research links creative ideas with technical knowledge. We empower students to shape their own lives, achieve impact and create valued places for themselves through work and engagement in the wider community. RMIT understands how to do this during a period of deep technological change – because we have been through it before.

RMIT began helping people and organisations make the transition to an industrial society more than a century ago. RMIT remains a meeting place for people from diverse origins, a place of exchange and dialogue, creative conflict and collaboration where knowledge and skills are applied to create new understanding and value.

Today, we embrace the challenge of helping to shape a new urban and industrial renaissance in a global economy.

The innovation and pace of change now under way is immense. New industries are being created while others are destroyed. Yet more are being transformed and renewed. The mass factories of the past are being replaced by clusters of production centred around new knowledge, technology, skills and creativity.

Students, workers and institutions need entrepreneurship and teamwork to adapt and succeed.

Today, how we learn is just as important for success as where and what we learn. Being ready for life and work means combining contemporary ideas and deep knowledge with cutting-edge learning skills and methods.

We are passionately committed to growing interdisciplinary expertise and creative thinking, together with practical application and problem-solving directly relevant to the lives of the communities we serve.

Our commitment to serving students from all backgrounds is equally strong. This includes a responsibility to lead in supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, to ensure access and effective support for all students, and to embracing the global diversity and talent of all our students and staff.

In the coming years RMIT will offer programs and research in ways that will:

enhance creativity and impact
fully embrace the digital environment
get students, experts and employers working together
apply learning through work and enterprise
draw upon the leading edge of industry practice
introduce students to potential employers and investors
encourage students to belong to the life of their cities and their world
help students to start and succeed in enterprises of their own
We will deploy our distinctive research capabilities to make new discoveries, to innovate through practice and to generate ideas and culture that enrich the economy and community.

Our unique mix of interdisciplinary expertise and collaborative clustering will help to solve complex local national and global problems.

For RMIT, this approach is both historically grounded and firmly contemporary. This is how we were established and how we have developed over almost 130 years. Being a university of technology, design and enterprise and a great urban university located in some of the most dynamic and creative cities around the world gives us a major advantage.

By building on what we have achieved and embracing the possibilities of digital, economic and social transformation, RMIT will help to shape the future in a way that no other university can.

Our task is to bring the talents of our staff and students together with industry and the community to renew ourselves through teaching, learning, research and collaborative innovation, all supported by new technology.",4148,641,59,8,603,283,6.471138845553822,644,90.44,89.84,34.65,97.63,23.00,33.54,85.71,44.25,6.99,5.12,0.00,4.19,0.00,0.00,0.93,1.86,6.68,14.91,4.97,2.17,9.94,0.16,9.47,5.75,1.71,1.24,0.16,1.86,6.21,5.75,0.47,0.00,0.16,0.00,9.47,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.87,3.57,4.66,0.47,0.78,1.40,0.78,0.47,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.93,0.00,0.78,0.16,0.00,18.94,7.14,6.21,5.43,2.17,0.31,1.09,7.30,1.24,14.75,2.02,9.01,3.88,12.73,0.16,0.00,1.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.16,4.35,4.04,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00

SCIENCES PO PARIS,"Established in 1952, CERI is the most preeminent research center in France that concentrates on both international/transnational relations and regional studies. It is also the largest of Sciences Po’s research units, with a faculty of 53 permanent, 7 emeritus and 26 associated scholars. 108 Ph.D. students enrolled at Sciences Po’s Doctoral School for the academic year of 2015-2016 are affiliated with CERI and work under the supervision of its scholars. CERI currently hosts 2 postdocs (one long-term Marie Curie fellow and one ERC postdoc) and employs several research assistants.

CERI’s excellence in scholarship translates into partnerships with sister institutions abroad, such as the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies, the Department of International Relations and the European Institute at LSE, the Department of War Studies at King’s College, and the CERIUM, Montréal. These partnerships are established due to the many projects undertaken over the years as part of collaborative research programs under FP7, one of which (MIME – Mobility and Inclusion in a Multilingual Europe) is still ongoing. CERI also participates in the ERC project WAFAW (When Authoritarianism Fails in the Arab Word).

CERI brings together scholars from several disciplines in the social sciences – first and foremost, political science, but also sociology, anthropology, history and economics. With regard to CERI’s regional expertise, the Muslim world is first (with 13 permanent scholars who specialize on countries stretching from Morocco to the Arabic Peninsula and Iran), followed by Latin American, Asian, East European and African studies. Fieldwork, empirical and comparative methods and knowledge of local languages are essential characteristics of CERI’s approach to area studies. 

Research at CERI is structured around five broad themes: politics and identities (including religion and nationalism); security and risks, international politics, regional integration and globalization, and States and political systems. CERI scholars also work together in smaller research groups focusing on specific topics of common interest: there are currently 19 groups, 6 of which are in the field of area studies, 6 in IR/transnational relations and 7 in comparative politics. 

CERI also reaches out to policy makers and government agencies (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense…), media outlets, NGOs and corporations. It has a well-established tradition of organizing public events and disseminating knowledge through its many publications, which include two book series with UK and US based publishers: “International Relations and Political Economy” (Palgrave Macmillan) and “Comparative Politics and International Studies” (Hurst/OUP, concentrating on the Arab world, Islam, ethnicity and nationalism), two academic journals (Critique Internationale and the European Review of International Studies) and a working papers series (Les Etudes du CERI).

excellent research university. Our goal
is to continue to develop science and
technology for the benefit of our society.
The members of the university are
wholly committed to the principle of
sustainable development which tackles
contemporary challenges without
further burdening future generations.
For us, research and teaching are inseparably
linked.
Using innovative, technologyoriented
and holistic methodologies
we are contributing to the shaping of a
better future. We are fully aware of our
responsibility vis-à-vis society – not only
due to our history – but also because
we must uphold ethical and humanistic
oriented standards in our research and
teaching endeavors. It is against this
background that research and teaching
in the natural, planning and engineering
sciences are inextricably linked with the
humanities and social sciences. All our
research and teaching activities serve
civilian purposes exclusively.
Our university members are actively
engaged in promoting equal opportunity
between women and men and in creating
family-friendly study and working
conditions. We strive to ensure equal
opportunity and non-discrimination at
all levels of the university organization.
In our teaching and research we also
explicitly embrace the plurality of world
views and diverse ways of life.
RESEARCH
We carry out basic and applicationoriented
research at a top international
level. On the basis of our comprehensive
spectrum of disciplines we establish
fields of future scientific focus and
promote cross-faculty research activities
and networks with external actors.
TEACHING AND ACADEMICS
TU Berlin is an attractive educational
institution in which students acquire the
academic and social competencies they
will need for their careers and to actively
shape the society of the future.
The broad range of subjects offered
by TU Berlin provides students a
transdisciplinary scientific education,
which in turn is an expression of the 
universityʼs societal and global responsibilities.
Continuing education in science is
an integrative component of university
training and enables lifelong learning.
We are open to the concept of
innovation as the basis for constantly
improving our university. We are continuously
refining the quality of instruction
by promoting dialogue between
our teachers and students, in addition
to developing further options that can
ensure the ongoing professionalization
of our academic staff.
PRACTICE-ORIENTED
KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER
We promote knowledge and technology
transfer between our university and
practical applications. We form strategic
alliances with companies, as well as with
university and non-university research
facilities. We also promote innovation
transfer through spin-offs and by supporting
TU Berlin members in establishing
their own companies. We organize
public discussions, advise policy actors,
we are active members in a regional and
supra-regional network, and we foster
relationships with our alumni.
ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE
TU Berlin regards itself as a learning
organization that continuously develops
its human resources. All status
groups contribute to achieving optimal
organizational and management
structures and to positively impacting
university life. We operate our facilities
in a safe, healthy, resource-friendly and
environmentally conscious manner.

UNIVERSITÄT ERLANGEN-NÜRNBERG,"Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) was founded on November 4th, 1743. While retaining a strong sense of tradition, the University has developed into a leading institution offering one of the broadest spectrums of courses available at any German university. Our goals at FAU are to specialise in areas of research that will shape the future and to create a network of interdisciplinary co-operation between technical, scientific and traditional subjects.
FAU is one of the leading research-focused universities in Germany. We work actively to build on this position and strive to guarantee freedom in research as a prerequisite for scientific advancement. FAU is committed to the unity of research and education. The research we undertake is oriented towards both theory and its practical applications. At FAU we are constantly developing new areas of expertise of particular significance for the future of science and society. Established scientific and ethical standards guide our research: methods are transparent and newly gained knowledge is discussed and debated in open exchanges with the academic community and the wider public.
FAU recognises its social responsibility and continually strives to optimise teaching and learning at the University. A key focus is placed on providing our students with an education based on knowledge and the methods required to apply this knowledge. We educate our students to be critical, independent individuals. FAU advocates the principle of lifelong learning. Our goal is to enable people to update, enrich and extend their knowledge at any stage in life through a structured and expanding range of professional development courses.
One aim of particular importance to us at FAU is to provide researchers in the early stages of their academic careers with the highest level of support and skills. This means, above all, giving young researchers the opportunity to take on responsibility and to conduct research independently. Professors at FAU serve as sources of support and role models in setting standards.
Scientific progress and interdisciplinary research are rooted in subject-specific expertise of the highest quality. FAU specifically promotes exchange between the disciplines, thus maximising the potential for innovative scientific progress and the creation of new study constellations.
FAU has an outward-looking, international perspective and is committed to promoting mutual understanding between nationalities and cultures. We support knowledge transfer and mobility, as well as personal exchange in research and teaching. Students, teachers and researchers from across the globe have the opportunity to contribute to and be an active part of university life.
The strength of the local connections established by FAU can be seen in the diverse range of co-operations with businesses and research institutes, as well as with educational and cultural institutions throughout the region. FAU constitutes a seedbed for successful business start-ups and enriches cultural diversity.
The achievement of equal opportunities for all employees, male and female, is of the utmost importance to us at FAU. Nobody is discriminated against or disadvantaged on the basis of gender, nationality, religious beliefs, social background or disability. FAU strives to offer a balance between study, work and family.

UNIVERSITÄT FREIBURG,"Founded in 1457, the University of Freiburg is one of the oldest German universities and is now one of the
nation’s leading research and teaching institutions. Proud of its 550-year history in the center of Europe, the
University of Freiburg is consciously aware of its intellectual roots in the occidental Christian tradition, especially
in the humanism of the Upper Rhine. Building on the original disciplines of theology, law, medicine, and
philosophy, it cherishes its mission of passing on the classical cultural heritage to new generations and
continuing the southern German liberal tradition. At the same time, the university is dedicated to defining and
pioneering new research areas and promoting a strategical interweaving of the natural and social sciences with
the humanities.
Freiburg’s central position in Europe, in the corner where Switzerland, France, and Germany meet, where it is
nestled in one of the oldest cultural landscapes north of the Alps, has had an unmistakable influence on the
town. The university is an essential element of the quality of life in Freiburg; both in the academic sphere and
in the perception of the general public, the activities of the university are of central importance and highly
attractive. From time immemorial, teaching, learning, and research have formed an indivisible whole. A glance
at the list of leading academic figures and Nobel prize winners associated with the university, even only of those
who taught and researched in the twentieth century – featuring well-known names such as A. Weismann, E.
Husserl, M. Heidegger, W. Eucken, H. Friedrich, H. Spemann, H. Staudinger, A. von Hayek, P. Ehrlich, O.
Wieland, G. von Hevesy, H. Krebs and G. Köhler – provides evidence enough that the University of Freiburg is
and always has been a charismatic center of supreme academic achievement in all disciplines. On this basis,
the University of Freiburg views its social task as being situated at the point at which progress, liberty, and
responsibility intersect.
The University of Freiburg thus shows consideration for the life situations of women and men in all domains of
society and promotes measures for realizing equal opportunity and a higher percentage of female employees,
both at the university itself and further afield. In addition to being a general expression of societal responsibility,
this policy also serves to further the excellence of research and instruction in all academic disciplines.
Philosophy still forms the center of the great network of the humanities at the University of Freiburg today. The
institution owes a great deal of its worldwide recognition to the intellectual excellence of its humanities
disciplines.
It is evident and internationally recognized that the University of Freiburg is pursuing a consistent policy to set
up cross-disciplinary networks at all levels. In the area of teaching, this involves an above-average proportion
of interdisciplinary modules and a consistently cross-disciplinary orientation of the courses at the Master’s level.
Where research is concerned, this notion manifests itself in the founding of interdisciplinary centers and aboveall
in the founding of the Faculty of Applied Sciences, which makes the University of Freiburg the only classical
university to combine traditional disciplines with the entire spectrum of microsystems technologies.
We strongly believe that top-level research – firmly established on the foundation of a solid grounding in an
individual discipline – can only be successful in the interplay between the disciplines. This conviction has led
us to persistently stimulate the development of transdisciplinary networks in all of the central research and
teaching areas. On the one hand, this strategy will open up new research fields, and on the other hand it ensures
that we are optimally equipped for the scientific challenges of the twenty-first century. The life sciences, which
link biochemistry, molecular cell biology, systems biology, applied science, neurosciences, medicine,
mathematics, physics, and various humanities disciplines, already constitute a successful and internationally
highly acclaimed example of this strategy. This initiative promises outstanding solutions to some of the centra
l scientific problems of our time. In close collaboration – increasingly documented in joint appointments – with 2
external research institutions such as the five Fraunhofer Institutes, the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology,
and the Kiepenheuer Solar Physics Institute as well as partners in the business sector, the university has a
major role at the forefront of the development of innovative forms of cooperation and in exploring new research
fields. Notable discoveries and significant technical innovations with genuine practical applications have already
resulted from the bundling of these research capacities within and beyond the university. This synergetic effect
is reinforced by the university’s membership of the European Confederation of Universities on the Upper Rhine
(EUCOR), a cross-border tri-national association of the seven universities of the Upper Rhine, founded in 1989.
The University of Freiburg wholeheartedly supports the vision of a single unbounded research landscape in the
upper Rhine region in which universities and businesses work together in close collaboration. Collaboration in
all areas of teaching and research on the basis of the intensive exchange of students and lecturers, the setting
up of joint research programs, reciprocal recognition of study credits and degrees, and the development of bior
even tri-national university courses are some of the central tasks and objectives of this confederation of
universities.
Thanks to these initiatives and preliminary results, and in association with disciplines and faculties which have
all been given a first-class rating, the University of Freiburg is confident of maintaining its leading position in the
German university landscape. The infrastructural conditions for sustained top-level performance in teaching
and research are optimal. The university’s leading position in research is simultaneously the basis for an
excellent education, which makes the University of Freiburg one of the most attractive academic centers in
Europe; its graduates have high recruitment potential as the elite of the academic, economic, and political world
of the future.",6410,960,120,15,836,420,6.677083333333333,964,99.00,63.40,27.01,77.35,22.95,37.97,79.88,43.57,4.46,0.41,0.00,0.41,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.05,12.14,17.22,3.42,1.97,5.19,0.00,4.56,5.81,1.76,1.04,1.56,1.97,3.11,2.90,0.10,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.11,0.00,0.10,0.21,0.10,6.33,1.97,2.28,0.21,0.52,1.45,0.10,0.73,0.31,0.00,0.21,1.14,0.21,0.62,0.00,0.10,9.13,1.97,3.63,3.94,1.35,0.10,1.04,4.05,0.31,15.46,0.83,12.03,2.59,13.17,0.10,0.00,0.62,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.10,0.00,0.10,0.00,12.97,4.36,6.43,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,1.24,0.00,0.52,0.21,0.00
UNIVERSITÄT HAMBURG,"ur institution contributes to the development of intercultural education in the field of Protestant theology. Our team consists of four heads of study who supervise doctoral dissertations by students from Africa, Latin America, Asia and Ozeania.

Besides the academic work with the stipend holders, the Academy of Mission is a place where international conferences are being held. Conferences may be organized by our team or by groups renting our facilities.

In addition, the Academy of Mission is considered a laboratory of ecumenical theology. We offer a space for discussing subjects relevant for the Protestant world. In particular, we closely observe the surprising dynamics of the unfolding of charismatic and evangelical movements in global and local perspectives. Other subjects of special interest to us, are globalization, and questions of justice and peace. Hamburg, as economic center with a long standing, global commercial history, represents a unique environment where the implications and consequences of globalization can be perceived and studied.

Pastors and leaders of African migrant churches have discovererd the Academy of Mission as a place for theological formation where diverse perspectives on the world, on religion, faith and theology can be shared in an athmosphere of utmost respect. A good number of African pastors residing in Germany have participated in the ATTiG  program (African Theological Training in Germany) which aims at deepening theological understanding by insisting on the contextuality of all forms of theology, including classical western theology.

The Academy of Mission was installed in the 1950ies as a place for the theological formation of missionaries to be sent out into the “mission fields”. Due to beginning processes of decolonization in Africa however, the function of the Academy of Mission was quickly changed. Ever since it has become a theological institution dedicated to theological education in a global perspective.",1985,298,30,1,259,129,6.6610738255033555,298,99.00,75.96,35.63,75.57,21.29,41.61,80.87,45.97,3.69,2.35,0.00,2.01,0.34,0.00,0.00,1.34,10.40,20.81,6.04,1.68,4.70,0.00,7.38,3.69,1.68,1.68,0.34,0.67,2.68,2.68,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.70,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.04,2.35,1.34,0.34,1.01,0.67,1.01,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.34,0.34,0.00,0.00,7.38,3.69,1.34,2.68,0.34,0.34,2.68,5.03,0.34,15.77,1.34,12.75,2.01,9.73,0.67,0.34,1.01,6.71,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.74,4.70,4.70,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.67,0.00

UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,"The University of Notre Dame is a Catholic academic community of higher learning, animated from its origins by the Congregation of Holy Cross. The University is dedicated to the pursuit and sharing of truth for its own sake. As a Catholic university, one of its distinctive goals is to provide a forum where, through free inquiry and open discussion, the various lines of Catholic thought may intersect with all the forms of knowledge found in the arts, sciences, professions, and every other area of human scholarship and creativity.

The intellectual interchange essential to a university requires, and is enriched by, the presence and voices of diverse scholars and students. The Catholic identity of the University depends upon, and is nurtured by, the continuing presence of a predominant number of Catholic intellectuals. This ideal has been consistently maintained by the University leadership throughout its history. What the University asks of all its scholars and students, however, is not a particular creedal affiliation, but a respect for the objectives of Notre Dame and a willingness to enter into the conversation that gives it life and character. Therefore, the University insists upon academic freedom that makes open discussion and inquiry possible.

The University prides itself on being an environment of teaching and learning that fosters the development in its students of those disciplined habits of mind, body, and spirit that characterize educated, skilled, and free human beings. In addition, the University seeks to cultivate in its students not only an appreciation for the great achievements of human beings but also a disciplined sensibility to the poverty, injustice and oppression that burden the lives of so many. The aim is to create a sense of human solidarity and concern for the common good that will bear fruit as learning becomes service to justice.

Notre Dame also has a responsibility to advance knowledge in a search for truth through original inquiry and publication. This responsibility engages the faculty and students in all areas of the University, but particularly in graduate and professional education and research. The University is committed to constructive and critical engagement with the whole of human culture.

The University encourages a way of living consonant with a Christian community and manifest in prayer, liturgy and service. Residential life endeavors to develop that sense of community and of responsibility that prepares students for subsequent leadership in building a society that is at once more human and more divine.

Notre Dame’s character as a Catholic academic community presupposes that no genuine search for the truth in the human or the cosmic order is alien to the life of faith. The University welcomes all areas of scholarly activity as consonant with its mission, subject to appropriate critical refinement. There is, however, a special obligation and opportunity, specifically as a Catholic university, to pursue the religious dimensions of all human learning. Only thus can Catholic intellectual life in all disciplines be animated and fostered and a proper community of scholarly religious discourse be established.

In all dimensions of the University, Notre Dame pursues its objectives through the formation of an authentic human community graced by the Spirit of Christ.",3362,523,50,0,467,240,6.4282982791587,523,98.16,69.04,5.99,95.90,24.90,35.95,85.66,47.04,4.97,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.97,11.66,17.02,4.02,2.49,8.22,0.57,7.07,5.16,1.91,0.38,0.38,2.49,5.93,5.35,0.57,0.00,0.38,0.00,7.46,0.00,0.00,0.96,0.00,9.75,3.06,1.34,0.19,0.76,3.06,1.91,1.15,0.38,0.19,0.00,1.53,0.19,1.15,0.00,0.19,7.46,2.29,2.10,2.87,1.15,0.19,0.57,4.97,0.76,6.88,0.38,5.54,0.57,10.52,0.19,0.19,0.76,3.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.75,4.02,5.54,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.00

UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,"The central mission of the university of Southern California is the development of human beings and society as a whole through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit. The principal means by which our mission is accomplished are teaching, research, artistic creation, professional practice and selected forms of public service.

Our first priority as faculty and staff is the education of our students, from freshmen to postdoctorals, through a broad array of academic, professional, extracurricular and athletic programs of the first rank. The integration of liberal and professional learning is one of USC’s special strengths. We strive constantly for excellence in teaching knowledge and skills to our students, while at the same time helping them to acquire wisdom and insight, love of truth and beauty, moral discernment, understanding of self, and respect and appreciation for others.

Research of the highest quality by our faculty and students is fundamental to our mission. USC is one of a very small number of premier academic institutions in which research and teaching are inextricably intertwined, and on which the nation depends for a steady stream of new knowledge, art, and technology. Our faculty are not simply teachers of the works of others, but active contributors to what is taught, thought and practiced throughout the world.

USC is pluralistic, welcoming outstanding men and women of every race, creed and background. We are a global institution in a global center, attracting more international students over the years than any other American university. And we are private, unfettered by political control, strongly committed to academic freedom, and proud of our entrepreneurial heritage.

An extraordinary closeness and willingness to help one another are evident among USC students, alumni, faculty, and staff; indeed, for those within its compass the Trojan Family is a genuinely supportive community. Alumni, trustees, volunteers and friends of USC are essential to this family tradition, providing generous financial support, participating in university governance, and assisting students at every turn.

In our surrounding neighborhoods and around the globe, USC provides public leadership and public service in such diverse fields as health care, economic development, social welfare, scientific research, public policy and the arts. We also serve the public interest by being the largest private employer in the city of Los Angeles, as well as the city’s largest export industry in the private sector.

USC has played a major role in the development of Southern California for more than a century, and plays an increasingly important role in the development of the nation and the world. We expect to continue to play these roles for many centuries to come. Thus our planning, commitments and fiscal policies are directed toward building quality and excellence in the long term.",2933,453,59,6,422,194,6.474613686534217,453,96.10,88.75,19.75,99.00,25.17,34.00,86.53,45.03,6.18,3.53,0.00,3.31,0.00,0.00,0.22,2.65,8.61,16.56,4.19,1.99,8.83,0.22,6.84,6.18,2.87,0.88,1.10,1.77,6.18,6.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.60,0.44,0.44,0.22,0.22,7.51,2.43,0.88,0.44,0.44,1.99,1.55,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,15.45,5.52,3.09,7.51,0.22,0.00,0.66,6.18,0.44,12.36,0.66,9.05,2.65,13.69,1.77,0.66,0.44,0.44,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.22,0.00,13.47,3.97,8.83,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.00

UNIVERSITY OF WARSAW,"The University of Warsaw recognizes as still valid its mission as a public utility institution formulated by its founders in 1816:
 
“The University should not only maintain in the nation both learning and skills at the level they have already attained in the scholarly world, but also further develop and propagate them as well as apply their theory for the public good.”
 
The University realizes its aim with the participation of the whole University community: its scholars, students and staff.
 
Since its establishment our University’s community has written numerous glorious pages in its history. It has produced many outstanding scholars and created famous scientific schools. It actively resisted armed force, organizing clandestine classes when the University was not allowed to function openly. Our students and graduates have served Poland and the world. These proud annals are our continuing obligation.
 
We must also remember what has been inglorious: submission to political pressure, religious and social discrimination, expulsion of scholars and students. Let this be a living historical lesson for us.
 
University of Warsaw belongs to the community of universities and accepts its universal aims, and its name is bound up with the capital of Poland. In response to the challenges arising from the transformation of our country, the new position of Poland in Europe and the world and the education of a knowledge-based society, University of Warsaw defines it mission as follows:
1. The basis of the University’s activity is the unity of teaching and research.
The University brings together scholars from a variety of disciplines. It is the place of a diversity of scientific research. Young researchers in direct contact with teachers develop their research awareness and improve their methodological skills. At the same time the University propagates throughout society this multifaceted knowledge and these sophisticated skills. New communication technology allows this propagation to take place regionally, nationally and worldwide.
 
The University offers undergraduate and doctoral studies, organizes summer schools, postgraduate studies and vocational courses, initiates interdisciplinary programmes and introduces new teaching techniques.
 
The high level of scientific research, its connection with the education of students and the diversity and attractiveness of our teaching will determine the position of the University in the country and in the world, and so decide the University’s future. We seek to be the best Polish university and a leading university in Europe. We recognize our particular responsibility toward Central and Eastern Europe.
2. The mission of the University within society is to guarantee access to knowledge and acquisition of skill to all who are entitled.
Knowledge and education today decide the lot of people and entire nations. The University generates knowledge allowing us to know and understand the world around us. Skills acquired through study ensure high professional qualification and preparation for proper fulfilment of public roles.
3. The civic mission of the University is the formation of those elites who will in their activities serve the “imperio rationis” rather than the “ratione imperii”.
The University is a community of dialogue. The exchange of views, the clash of arguments, openness to new ideas and conceptions is bound up indissolubly here with respect for diversity and for personal dignity. In this way the University develops its capacity for cooperation regardless of political, ideological or religious differences, and creates a model of public debate. The shaping of the civic attitudes of students is thereby combined with the development of their personalities.
4. The cultural mission of the University is a synthesis of universal and local values.
In the emerging conflict between globalism and regionalism a special role is to be played by institutions which succeed in combining universal techniques of communication and knowledge of universal significance with maintenance of respect for the historical and cultural identity of regions and states. The University where many disciplines are cultivated – from mathematical and natural sciences to social and humanistic sciences – is a place where such a symbiosis exists naturally. The University is also an institution, which assists the dialogue between the integrating societies of Western Europe and its Eastern neighbours.

WASEDA UNIVERSITY,"Waseda University holds as its founding principles the preservation of the independence of scholarship, the promotion of the practical application of scholarship, and the fostering of good citizens.

Holding the independence of scholarship as a central principle, Waseda University pledges to contribute to the scholarship of the world by regarding freedom of research as essential and devoting itself constantly to original research.

Holding the practical application of scholarship as a central principle, Waseda University pledges to contribute to the progress of the times by establishing a path for the practical use of scholarship as well as pursuing theoretical research for its own sake.

Holding the fostering of good citizens as a central principle, Waseda University pledges to cultivate people of character who can respect individuality, develop themselves and their families, benefit the nation and society, and be active in the world at large.

Independence of Learning
Independence of Learning is tightly connected with the outsider’s spirit and a critical mind. Waseda University has promoted scientific education and research without bending to authority or temporal fashion, in order to produce independent modern citizens.

Practical Utilization of Knowledge
In the historical context, academic enterprises had to be useful for construction of the modern nation-state of Japan which was underway at that time. So the founding principle of Practical Utilization of Knowledge focuses not on shallow pragmatism but the spirit of progressivism.

Good Citizenship
The University was established with a focus on educating the common people, and cultivating Good Citizenship is one of the three founding principles. In today’s context of globalization it also means Good Global Citizenship.

WESTFÄLISCHE WILHELMS-UNIVERSITÄT MÜNSTER,"Top-level research

WWU Münster has developed a strong research profile in natural sciences, the humanities, medicine, law and business administration. It targets top-level research in high-performance areas for and combines this with promoting first-class young researchers. At the same time, by ensuring that broad research can be carried out it creates a secure basis on which excellence can thrive.

Research at the University of Münster

High-quality teaching

WWU Münster’s aims in the field of research are closely linked with its own commitment to provide high-quality courses of study covering a wide range of subjects. It has taken a pioneering lead in changing teacher training to the double bachelor degree. The second step – a bottom-up process – will involve the masters courses. The development of programmes for structured doctoral courses represents the third step in the realisation of the objectives set out in the Bologna process. WWU thus provides the best possible teaching on the basis of high-quality broad and top-level research.

Teaching at the University of Münster

Promoting young researchers

The WWU Münster organises the promotion of outstanding academic junior researchers in graduate schools which provide structured doctoral courses. Moreover the university creates an environment conducive to top-level research carried out by postdocs. It also supports the setting up of groups of young researchers and the creation of junior professorships in order to strengthen the links between postgraduate education and research.

Doctoral funding

Gender mainstreaming

WWU Münster considers gender equality to be a task of strategic importance. The aim is to make it easier for women to combine an academic career and family interests. It is in combination with the high quality of life offered by the Münster region that the university hopes to reap benefits in recruiting brilliant researchers in the future. WWU’s second strategic objective in the field of gender mainstreaming is to apply suitable measures to strengthen women’s social qualifications in pursuing academic careers. In order to initiate such measures to reach these goals, WWU subjects its gender mainstreaming policies to an external “family-friendly university audit”.",2268,340,32,6,303,131,6.670588235294118,348,99.00,65.64,29.77,95.04,21.75,38.51,80.17,37.93,4.02,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.02,10.34,17.82,3.16,0.86,2.01,0.00,4.89,7.76,2.59,0.57,1.15,0.86,4.89,4.60,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.02,0.57,0.29,0.57,0.29,4.89,0.86,2.87,0.57,0.57,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.44,0.00,1.44,0.00,0.00,15.52,1.44,4.89,10.06,2.01,0.29,0.86,4.89,0.57,17.53,1.72,13.51,1.72,17.53,0.57,0.57,0.86,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.63,4.60,1.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.16,0.57,0.86,0.00,0.00

Zuora,"Customers have changed. They‚Äôre looking for new ways to engage with businesses. Consumers today have a new set of expectations. They want outcomes, not ownership. Customization, not generalization. Constant improvement, not planned obsoleteness. The result? Businesses are changing the way they sell their products and services. Over the past 9 years, we‚Äôve seen an explosion of new types of business models all designed to keep customers consistently engaged in long-term relationships‚Äîthink Netflix, Amazon Prime, Uber, Spotify, Salesforce, Zendesk, Box. The Subscription Economy is a phrase (coined by CEO Tien Tzuo) to describe this new era of companies and business models. In the old world (let‚Äôs call it the Product Economy) it was all about things. Acquiring new customers, shipping commodities, billing for one-time transactions. But in this new era, it‚Äôs all about relationships. More and more customers are becoming subscribers because subscription experiences built around services meet consumers‚Äô needs better than the static offerings or a single product. Focusing on relationships requires a new way of thinking, both for consumers and businesses. Rather than focusing on the ‚Äúproduct‚Äù or the ‚Äútransaction,‚Äù Subscription Economy companies live and die by their ability to focus on the customer. Zuora is built specifically to help companies navigate this transition to the new economy and achieve unprecedented levels of growth. Welcome to the new world of happy business.",1507,223,39,1,180,83,6.757847533632287,233,96.16,60.17,33.57,73.82,12.94,33.05,79.40,36.91,5.58,2.58,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.00,2.15,3.00,7.30,13.73,3.86,2.15,4.29,1.29,9.01,6.87,2.15,0.00,1.29,3.00,2.58,2.58,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.16,0.86,3.43,1.72,0.86,1.72,3.86,1.29,0.86,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.00,6.87,3.00,2.58,1.72,1.29,0.00,1.72,6.44,0.43,15.45,1.29,6.44,7.73,12.45,0.86,0.00,9.01,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.74,7.30,6.44,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.86,0.00,0.00,1.72,0.00
